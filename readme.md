**If you haven't gathered by now, I'm being cheeky.** 

While searching around for examples of GitHub profile templates, I noticed most are a strange mix of resume-type content, personal interest content and _absurd quantities of emojis._

To each, their own; but that's not the cut of my jib.

### About Me, For Real This Time

I am an IT infrastructure professional with more than 15 years of very broad and eclectic experience. However, _I am not_ a programmer or data or computer scientist, nor do I aspire to be one.

**So, why have a GitHub?**

Like most IT professionals, there have been innumerable cases where I've had one of two options:

* Do repetitive tasks manually, frequently and slowly; _or_

* Figure out how to script and automate those tasks.

As a inwardly lazy person, I opted for the latter. By front-loading the time effort into a scripting language, I've turned a 70-hour/week job into a 40-hour/week job.

The result is that I've become reasonably proficient
